Logger : change writeJobActivation : shouldn't take a list.

Tasks (every task) : delete getNextJob / getNextArrivalTime => TimeTrigged dies.
                     rename getRealNextJob.
                     delete interArrivalTimes in sporadicTasks (TimeTrigged dies).

Check if the result is good.

First job => only one use.

Change every "AbstractTaskSet" to "ITaskSet".

private List<IEvent> eventsToAdd delete reset.

Sort some lists to have a easier complexity (avoid multiple loops on it).

SporadicTask : let the user choose the distribution.
