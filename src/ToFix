Logger : change writeJobActivation : shouldn't take a list.

Tasks (every task) : delete getNextJob / getNextArrivalTime => TimeTrigged dies.
                     rename getRealNextJob.

In comparison between two events : using toString to compare (only for testing faster). To be fixed.

Doesn't work with sporadic.
