This file is written is Json format. The parser first needs to know that the file is supposed to be well formed so the first object is "events".
The "events" field is an array of events.

Each event has 3 necessary fields : name, class and priority
The "name" of an event is a unique String. Two same name in the same configuration will make the program use the last name encountered.
The "class" of an event is a String that reference the class used for the event with the packages.
The "priority" of an event is a Integer giving the priority of this event if two or more events trigger at the same time, the lowest Integer being the highest priority.

For the program to work, a event named "Activation" is necessary, it is the first event to trigger the simulation.
Events may have the same priority, it is up to the developer to make sure this two events won't trigger at the same time.
It is also possible and recommended to use the same name as other configuration if some classes you need already exist, but pointing ot other classes if needed.

An example of events for the basic algorithms with preemption is given :

{
  "events": [
    {
      "name": "SimulatorStop",
      "class": "grts.core.simulator.events.SimulatorStopEvent",
      "priority": 1
    },
    {
      "name": "Preemption",
      "class": "grts.core.simulator.events.PreemptionEvent",
      "priority": 8
    },
    {
      "name": "JobExecutionStop",
      "class": "grts.core.simulator.events.JobExecutionStopEvent",
      "priority": 1
    },
    {
      "name": "JobExecutionStart",
      "class": "grts.core.simulator.events.JobExecutionStartEvent",
      "priority": 9
    },
    {
      "name": "Activation",
      "class": "grts.core.simulator.events.JobActivationEvent",
      "priority": 6
    },
    {
      "name": "DeadlineMissed",
      "class": "grts.core.simulator.events.DeadlineMissedEvent",
      "priority": 4
    },
    {
      "name": "DeadlineCheck",
      "class": "grts.core.simulator.events.DeadlineCheckEvent",
      "priority": 5
    },
    {
      "name": "ContinueOrStopExecution",
      "class": "grts.core.simulator.events.ContinueOrStopExecutionEvent",
      "priority": 0
    },
    {
      "name": "ChooseJob",
      "class": "grts.core.simulator.events.ChooseJobEvent",
      "priority": 7
    }
  ]
}
