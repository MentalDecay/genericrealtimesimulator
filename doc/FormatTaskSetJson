This file is written is Json format. The parser first needs to know that the file is supposed to be well formed so the first object is "tasks".
The "tasks" field is an array of tasks.
Right now two types of tasks are implemented : Periodic tasks and Sporadic tasks.

"Periodic task" : contains at least the "wcet" (Worst Case Execution Time), the period and a name. In options, an offset, a deadline and "shared memory".
"shared memory" allows the task to use a specific resource during a specific time.
For instance :
"shared memory" :
          [
            {
              "from" : "1",
              "to" : "3",
              "resource" : "id"
            }
          ]
will allow the task to use the resource "id" during its execution from the first unit of time to the third unit of time.

"Sporadic task": contains almost the same things except for the "period" which became "minimum inter arrival time".

Every task can have in option the "energy" field. This field contains an object which contains every field to represent the energy.

An example of tasks set is given :

{
  "tasks" :
  [
    {
     "Periodic task" :
     {
       "wcet" : "2",
       "period" : "7",
       "name" : "t1",
       "options" :
       {
         "energy" :
         {
           "wcec" : "5"
         }
       }
     }
    },
    {
      "Periodic task" :
      {
        "wcet" : "3",
        "period" : "11",
        "name" : "t2",
        "options" :
        {
          "memory" : "128",
          "offset" : "0"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Periodic task" :
      {
        "wcet" : "5",
        "period" : "13",
        "name" : "t3",
        "options" :
        {
          "deadline" : "13",
          "shared memory" :
          [
            {
              "from" : "1",
              "to" : "3",
              "resource" : "id"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
